# Supported compliance profiles


There are several profiles available as part of the Compliance Operator (CO)
installation. While you can use the following profiles to assess gaps in a
cluster, usage alone does not infer or guarantee compliance with a particular
profile and is not an auditor.
In order to be compliant or certified under these various standards, you need
to engage an authorized auditor such as a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA),
Joint Authorization Board (JAB), or other industry recognized regulatory
authority to assess your environment. You are required to work with an
authorized auditor to achieve compliance with a standard.

# Compliance profiles

The Compliance Operator provides profiles to meet industry standard benchmarks.


[NOTE]
----
The following tables reflect the latest available profiles in the Compliance Operator.
----

## CIS compliance profiles



1. The  ocp4-cis and ocp4-cis-node profiles maintain the most up-to-date version of the CIS benchmark as it becomes available in the Compliance Operator. If you want to adhere to a specific version, such as CIS v1.4.0, use the ocp4-cis-1-4 and ocp4-cis-node-1-4 profiles.
2. Node profiles must be used with the relevant Platform profile. For more information, see Compliance Operator profile types.
3. CIS v1.4.0 is superceded by CIS v1.5.0. It is recommended to apply the latest profile to your environment.
4. To locate the CIS Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform v4 Benchmark, go to  CIS Benchmarks and click Download Latest CIS Benchmark, where you can then register to download the benchmark.

## Essential Eight compliance profiles



## FedRAMP High compliance profiles



1. The  ocp4-high, ocp4-high-node and rhcos4-high profiles maintain the most up-to-date version of the FedRAMP High standard as it becomes available in the Compliance Operator. If you want to adhere to a specific version, such as FedRAMP high R4, use the ocp4-high-rev-4 and ocp4-high-node-rev-4 profiles.
2. Node profiles must be used with the relevant Platform profile. For more information, see Compliance Operator profile types.

## FedRAMP Moderate compliance profiles



1. The  ocp4-moderate, ocp4-moderate-node and rhcos4-moderate profiles maintain the most up-to-date version of the FedRAMP Moderate standard as it becomes available in the Compliance Operator. If you want to adhere to a specific version, such as FedRAMP Moderate R4, use the ocp4-moderate-rev-4 and ocp4-moderate-node-rev-4 profiles.
2. Node profiles must be used with the relevant Platform profile. For more information, see Compliance Operator profile types.

## NERC-CIP compliance profiles



1. Node profiles must be used with the relevant Platform profile. For more information, see Compliance Operator profile types.

## PCI-DSS compliance profiles



1. The  ocp4-pci-dss and ocp4-pci-dss-node profiles maintain the most up-to-date version of the PCI-DSS standard as it becomes available in the Compliance Operator. If you want to adhere to a specific version, such as PCI-DSS v3.2.1, use the ocp4-pci-dss-3-2 and ocp4-pci-dss-node-3-2 profiles.
2. Node profiles must be used with the relevant Platform profile. For more information, see Compliance Operator profile types.
3. PCI-DSS v3.2.1 is superceded by PCI-DSS v4. It is recommended to apply the latest profile to your environment.

## STIG compliance profiles



1. The  ocp4-stig, ocp4-stig-node and rhcos4-stig profiles maintain the most up-to-date version of the DISA-STIG benchmark as it becomes available in the Compliance Operator. If you want to adhere to a specific version, such as DISA-STIG V2R1, use the ocp4-stig-v2r1 and ocp4-stig-node-v2r1 profiles.
2. Node profiles must be used with the relevant Platform profile. For more information, see Compliance Operator profile types.
3. DISA-STIG V1R1 is superceded by DISA-STIG V2R1. It is recommended to apply the latest profile to your environment.

## About extended compliance profiles

Some compliance profiles have controls that require following industry best practices, resulting in some profiles extending others. Combining the Center for Internet Security (CIS) best practices with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) security frameworks establishes a path to a secure and compliant environment.

For example, the NIST High-Impact and Moderate-Impact profiles extend the CIS profile to achieve compliance. As a result, extended compliance profiles eliminate the need to run both profiles in a single cluster.
