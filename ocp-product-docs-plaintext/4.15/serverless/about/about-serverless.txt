# OpenShift Serverless overview



OpenShift Serverless provides Kubernetes native building blocks that enable developers to create and deploy serverless, event-driven applications on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. OpenShift Serverless is based on the open source Knative project, which provides portability and consistency for hybrid and multi-cloud environments by enabling an enterprise-grade serverless platform.


[NOTE]
----
Because OpenShift Serverless releases on a different cadence from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the OpenShift Serverless documentation is now available as a separate documentation set at Red Hat OpenShift Serverless.
