[IMPORTANT]
----
The Cluster Observability Operator monitoring UI plugin is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.

The monitoring UI plugin adds monitoring features to the Administrator perspective of the OpenShift web console.
* RHACM: The monitoring plugin in Cluster Observability Operator (COO) allows it to function in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) environments, providing RHACM with the same alerting capabilities as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can configure the plugin to fetch alerts from the RHACM Alertmanager backend. This enables seamless integration and user experience by aligning RHACM and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring workflows.
