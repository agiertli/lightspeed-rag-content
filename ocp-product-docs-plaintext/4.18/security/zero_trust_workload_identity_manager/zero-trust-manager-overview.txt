# Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager overview



[IMPORTANT]
----
Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.

The Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager leverages Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone (SPIFFE) and the SPIFFE Runtime Environment (SPIRE) to provide a comprehensive identity management solution for distributed systems. SPIFFE and SPIRE provide a standardized approach to workload identity, allowing workloads to communicate with other services whether on the same cluster, or in another environment.
Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager replaces long-lived, manually managed secrets with cryptographically verifiable identities. It provides strong authentication ensuring workloads that are communicating with each other are who they claim to be. SPIRE automates the issuing, rotating, and revoking of a SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document (SVID), reducing the workload of developers and administrators managing secrets.
SPIFFE can work across diverse infrastructures including on-premise, cloud, and hybrid environments. SPIFFE identities are cryptographically enabled providing a basis for auditing and compliance.
The following are components of the Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager architecture:

# SPIFFE

Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone (SPIFFE) provides a standardized way to establish trust between software workloads in distributed systems. SPIFFE assigns unique IDs called SPIFFE IDs. These IDs are Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) that include a trust domain and a workload identifier.

The SPIFFE IDs are contained in the SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document (SVID). SVIDs are used by workloads to verify their identity to other workloads so that the workloads can communicate with each other. The two main SVID formats are:

* X.509-SVIDs: X.509 certificates where the SPIFFE ID is embedded in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field.
* JWT-SVIDs: JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) where the SPIFFE ID is included as the sub claim.
For more information, see SPIFFE Overview.

# SPIRE server

A SPIRE server is responsible for managing and issuing SPIFFE identities within a trust domain. It stores registration entries (selectors that determine under what conditions a SPIFFE ID should be issued) and signing keys. The SPIRE server works in conjunction with the SPIRE agent to perform node attestion via node plugins. For more information, see About the SPIRE server.

# SPIRE agent

The SPIRE Agent is responsible for workload attestation, ensuring that workloads receive a verified identity when requesting authentication through the SPIFFE Workload API. It accomplishes this by using configured workload attestor plugins. In Kubernetes environments, the Kubernetes workload attestor plugin is used.

SPIRE and the SPIRE agent perform node attestation via node plugins. The plugins are used to verify the identity of the node on which the agent is running. For more information, see About the SPIRE Agent.

# Attestation

Attestation is the process by which the identity of nodes and workloads are verified before SPIFFE IDs and SVIDs are issued. The SPIRE server gathers attributes of both the workload and node that the SPIRE Agent runs on, and then compares them to a set of selectors defined when the workload was registered. If the comparison is successful, the entities are provided with credentials. This ensures that only legitimate and expected entities within the trust domain receive cryptographic identities. The two main types of attestation in SPIFFE/SPIRE are:

* Node attestation: verifies the identity of a machine or a node on a system, before a SPIRE agent running on that node can be trusted to request identities for workloads.
* Workload attestation: verifies the identity of an application or service running on an attested node before the SPIRE agent on that node can provide it with a SPIFFE ID and SVID.
For more information, see Attestation.

# Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager workflow

The following is a high-level workflow of the Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager within the Red&#160;Hat OpenShift cluster.

1. The SPIRE, SPIRE agent, SPIFFE CSI Driver, and the SPIRE OIDC Discovery Provider operands are deployed and managed by Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager via associated Customer Resource Definitions (CRDs).
2. Watches are then registered for relevant Kubernetes resources and the necessary SPIRE CRDs are applied to the cluster.
3. The CR for the ZeroTrustWorkloadIdentityManager resource named cluster is deployed and managed by a controller.
4. To deploy the SPIRE server, SPIRE agent, SPIFFE CSI Driver, and SPIRE OIDC Discovery Provider, you need to create a custom resource of a each certain type and name it cluster. The custom resource types are as follows:
* SPIRE server - SpireServer
* SPIRE agent - SpireAgent
* SPIFFE CSI Driver - SpiffeCSIDriver
* SPIRE OIDC discovery provider - SpireOIDCDiscoveryProvider
5. When a node starts, the SPIRE agent initializes, and connects to the SPIRE server.
6. The agent begins the node attestation process. The agent collects information on the node's identity such as label name and namespace. The agent securely provides the information it gathered through the attestation to the SPIRE server.
7. The SPIRE server then evaluates this information against its configured attestation policies and registration entries. If successful, the server generates an agent SVID and the Trust Bundle (CA Certificate) and securely sends this back to the agent.
8. A workload starts on the node and needs a secure identity. The workload connects to the agent's Workload API and requests a SVID.
9. The agent receives the request and begins a workload attestation to gather information about the workload.
10. After the agent gathers the information, the information is sent to the SPIRE server and the server checks its configured registration entries.
11. The agent receives the workload SVID and Trust Bundle and passes it on to the workload. The workload can now present their SVIDs to other SPIFFE-aware devices to communicate with them.
