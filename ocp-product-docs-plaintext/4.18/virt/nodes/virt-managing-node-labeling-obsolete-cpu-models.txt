# Managing node labeling for obsolete CPU models


You can schedule a virtual machine (VM) on a node as long as the VM CPU model and policy are supported by the node.

# Configuring obsolete CPU models

You can configure a list of obsolete CPU models by editing the HyperConverged custom resource (CR).

* Edit the HyperConverged custom resource, specifying the obsolete CPU models in the obsoleteCPUs array. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
  obsoleteCPUs:
    cpuModels: 1
      - "<obsolete_cpu_1>"
      - "<obsolete_cpu_2>"
```

Replace the example values in the cpuModels array with obsolete CPU models. Any value that you specify is added to a predefined list of obsolete CPU models. The predefined list is not visible in the CR.
