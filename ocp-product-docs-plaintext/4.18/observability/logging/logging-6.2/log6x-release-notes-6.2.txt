# Logging 6.2



# Logging 6.2.0 Release Notes

This release includes Logging for Red Hat OpenShift Bug Fix Release 6.2.0.

## New Features and Enhancements

### Log Collection

* With this update, HTTP outputs include a proxy field that you can use to send log data through an HTTP proxy. (LOG-6069)

### Log Storage

* With this update, time-based stream sharding in Loki is now enabled by the Loki Operator. This solves the issue of ingesting log entries older than the sliding time-window used by Loki. (LOG-6757)
* With this update, you can configure a custom certificate authority (CA) certificate with Loki Operator when using Swift as an object store. (LOG-4818)
* With this update, you can configure workload identity federation on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by using the Cluster Credential Operator in OpenShift 4.17 and later releases with the Loki Operator. (LOG-6158)

## Technology Preview


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.

* With this update, OpenTelemetry support offered by OpenShift Logging continues to improve, specifically in the area of enabling migrations from the ViaQ data model to OpenTelemetry when forwarding to LokiStack. (LOG-6146)
* With this update, the structuredMetadata field has been removed from Loki Operator in the otlp configuration because structured metadata is now the default type. Additionally, the update introduces a drop field that administrators can use to drop OpenTelemetry attributes when receiving data through OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP). (LOG-6507)

## Bug Fixes

* Before this update, the timestamp shown in the console logs did not match the @timestamp field in the message. With this update the timestamp is correctly shown in the console. (LOG-6222)
* The introduction of ClusterLogForwarder 6.x modified the ClusterLogForwarder API to allow for a consistent templating mechanism. However, this was not applied to the syslog output spec API for the facility and severity fields. This update adds the required validation to the ClusterLogForwarder API for the facility and severity fields. (LOG-6661)
* Before this update, an error in the Loki Operator generating the Loki configuration caused the amount of workers to delete to be zero when 1x.pico was set as the LokiStack size. With this update, the number of workers to delete is set to 10. (LOG-6781)

## Known Issues

* The previous data model encoded all information in JSON. The console still uses the query of the previous data model to decode both old and new entries. The logs that are stored by using the new OpenTelemetry data model for the LokiStack output display the following error in the logging console:

```
__error__ JSONParserErr
__error_details__ Value looks like object, but can't find closing '}' symbol
```


You can ignore the error as it is only a result of the query and not a data-related error. (LOG-6808)
* Currently, the API documentation incorrectly mentions OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) attributes as included instead of excluded in the descriptions of the drop field. (LOG-6839).

## CVEs

* CVE-2020-11023
