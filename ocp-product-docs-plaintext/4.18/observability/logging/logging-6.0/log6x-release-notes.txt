# Logging 6.0.0


This release includes Logging for Red Hat OpenShift Bug Fix Release 6.0.0

[NOTE]
----
Logging is provided as an installable component, with a distinct release cycle from the core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy outlines release compatibility.
----

# Removal notice

* With this release, logging no longer supports the ClusterLogging.logging.openshift.io and ClusterLogForwarder.logging.openshift.io custom resources. Refer to the product documentation for details on the replacement features. (LOG-5803)
* With this release, logging no longer manages or deploys log storage (such as Elasticsearch), visualization (such as Kibana), or Fluentd-based log collectors. (LOG-5368)


[NOTE]
----
In order to continue to use Elasticsearch and Kibana managed by the elasticsearch-operator, the administrator must modify those object's ownerRefs before deleting the ClusterLogging resource.
----

# New features and enhancements

* This feature introduces a new architecture for logging for Red Hat OpenShift by shifting component responsibilities to their relevant Operators, such as for storage, visualization, and collection. It introduces the ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io API for log collection and forwarding. Support for the ClusterLogging.logging.openshift.io and ClusterLogForwarder.logging.openshift.io APIs, along with the Red Hat managed Elastic stack (Elasticsearch and Kibana), is removed. Users are encouraged to migrate to the Red Hat LokiStack for log storage. Existing managed Elasticsearch deployments can be used for a limited time. Automated migration for log collection is not provided, so administrators need to create a new ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io specification to replace their previous custom resources. Refer to the official product documentation for more details. (LOG-3493)
* With this release, the responsibility for deploying the logging view plugin shifts from the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator to the Cluster Observability Operator (COO). For new log storage installations that need visualization, the Cluster Observability Operator and the associated UIPlugin resource must be deployed. For more information, see Visualization for logging. (LOG-5461)

[IMPORTANT]
----
Until the approaching General Availability (GA) release of the Cluster Observability Operator (COO), which is currently in Technology Preview (TP), Red Hat provides support to customers who are using Logging 6.0 or later with the COO for its Logging UI Plugin on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 or later. This support exception is temporary as the COO includes several independent features, some of which are still TP features, but the Logging UI Plugin is ready for GA.

* This enhancement sets default requests and limits for Vector collector deployments' memory and CPU usage based on Vector documentation recommendations. (LOG-4745)
* This enhancement updates Vector to align with the upstream version v0.37.1. (LOG-5296)
* This enhancement introduces an alert that triggers when log collectors buffer logs to a node's file system and use over 15% of the available space, indicating potential back pressure issues. (LOG-5381)
* This enhancement updates the selectors for all components to use common Kubernetes labels. (LOG-5906)
* This enhancement changes the collector configuration to deploy as a ConfigMap instead of a secret, allowing users to view and edit the configuration when the ClusterLogForwarder is set to Unmanaged. (LOG-5599)
* This enhancement adds the ability to configure the Vector collector log level using an annotation on the ClusterLogForwarder, with options including trace, debug, info, warn, error, or off. (LOG-5372)
* This enhancement adds validation to reject configurations where Amazon CloudWatch outputs use multiple AWS roles, preventing incorrect log routing. (LOG-5640)
* This enhancement removes the Log Bytes Collected and Log Bytes Sent graphs from the metrics dashboard. (LOG-5964)
* This enhancement updates the must-gather functionality to only capture information for inspecting Logging 6.0 components, including Vector deployments from ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io resources and the Red Hat managed LokiStack. (LOG-5949)
* This enhancement improves Azure storage secret validation by providing early warnings for specific error conditions. (LOG-4571)

# Technology Preview features

* This release introduces a Technology Preview feature for log forwarding using OpenTelemetry. A new output type,` OTLP`, allows sending JSON-encoded log records using the OpenTelemetry data model and resource semantic conventions. (LOG-4225)

# Bug fixes

* Before this update, the CollectorHighErrorRate and CollectorVeryHighErrorRate alerts were still present. With this update, both alerts are removed in the logging 6.0 release but might return in a future release. (LOG-3432)

# CVEs

* CVE-2024-34397
