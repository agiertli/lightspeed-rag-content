# Default logging alerts


Logging alerts are installed as part of the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator installation. Alerts depend on metrics exported by the log collection and log storage backends. These metrics are enabled if you selected the option to Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace when installing the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator.
Default logging alerts are sent to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack Alertmanager in the openshift-monitoring namespace, unless you have disabled the local Alertmanager instance.

# Accessing the Alerting UI from the Administrator perspective



# Accessing the Alerting UI from the Developer perspective

The Alerting UI is accessible through the {perspective} perspective of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* From the Administrator perspective, go to Observe -> Alerting. The three main pages in the Alerting UI in this perspective are the Alerts, Silences, and Alerting rules pages.

* From the Developer perspective, go to Observe and go to the Alerts tab.
* Select the project that you want to manage alerts for from the Project: list.

In this perspective, alerts, silences, and alerting rules are all managed from the Alerts tab. The results shown in the Alerts tab are specific to the selected project.


[NOTE]
----
In the Developer perspective, you can select from core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and user-defined projects that you have access to in the Project: <project_name> list. However, alerts, silences, and alerting rules relating to core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform projects are not displayed if you are not logged in as a cluster administrator.
