# Creating a Backup CR



You back up Kubernetes images, internal images, and persistent volumes (PVs) by creating a Backup custom resource (CR).

* You must install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.
* The DataProtectionApplication CR must be in a Ready state.
* Backup location prerequisites:
* You must have S3 object storage configured for Velero.
* You must have a backup location configured in the DataProtectionApplication CR.
* Snapshot location prerequisites:
* Your cloud provider must have a native snapshot API or support Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.
* For CSI snapshots, you must create a VolumeSnapshotClass CR to register the CSI driver.
* You must have a volume location configured in the DataProtectionApplication CR.

1. Retrieve the backupStorageLocations CRs by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get backupstoragelocations.velero.io -n openshift-adp
```

Example output

```terminal
NAMESPACE       NAME              PHASE       LAST VALIDATED   AGE   DEFAULT
openshift-adp   velero-sample-1   Available   11s              31m
```

2. Create a Backup CR, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: <backup>
  labels:
    velero.io/storage-location: default
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  hooks: {}
  includedNamespaces:
  - <namespace> 1
  includedResources: [] 2
  excludedResources: [] 3
  storageLocation: <velero-sample-1> 4
  ttl: 720h0m0s 5
  labelSelector: 6
    matchLabels:
      app: <label_1>
      app: <label_2>
      app: <label_3>
  orLabelSelectors: 7
  - matchLabels:
      app: <label_1>
      app: <label_2>
      app: <label_3>
```

Specify an array of namespaces to back up.
Optional: Specify an array of resources to include in the backup. Resources might be shortcuts (for example, 'po' for 'pods') or fully-qualified. If unspecified, all resources are included.
Optional: Specify an array of resources to exclude from the backup. Resources might be shortcuts (for example, 'po' for 'pods') or fully-qualified.
Specify the name of the backupStorageLocations CR.
The ttl field defines the retention time of the created backup and the backed up data. For example, if you are using Restic as the backup tool, the backed up data items and data contents of the persistent volumes (PVs) are stored until the backup expires. But storing this data consumes more space in the target backup locations. An additional storage is consumed with frequent backups, which are created even before other unexpired completed backups might have timed out.
Map of {key,value} pairs of backup resources that have all the specified labels.
Map of {key,value} pairs of backup resources that have one or more of the specified labels.
3. Verify that the status of the Backup CR is Completed:

```terminal
$ oc get backups.velero.io -n openshift-adp <backup> -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'
```
