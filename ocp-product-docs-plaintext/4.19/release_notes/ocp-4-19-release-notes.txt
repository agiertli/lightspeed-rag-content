# About this release

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHSA-202X:XXXX) is now available. This release uses Kubernetes 1.32 with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 are included in this topic.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. From the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console, you can deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.8 and a later version of RHEL 8 that is released before End of Life of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 is also supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) 4.19. To understand RHEL versions used by RHCOS, see RHEL Versions Utilized by Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (Knowledgebase article).

You must use RHCOS machines for the control plane, and you can use either RHCOS or RHEL for compute machines. RHEL machines are deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 and will be removed in a future release.

Starting from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase for even-numbered releases increases the total available lifecycle to 24 months on all supported architectures, including x86_64, 64-bit ARM (aarch64), IBM Power&#174; (ppc64le), and IBM Z&#174; (s390x) architectures. Beyond this, Red&#160;Hat also offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as Additional EUS Term 2, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. For more information about support for all versions, see the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy.

Commencing with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 release, Red&#160;Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red&#160;Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see OpenShift Operator Life Cycles.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is designed for FIPS. When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see Cryptographic Module Validation Program. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see Compliance Activities and Government Standards.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform layered and dependent component support and compatibility

## Installation and update

### Cluster API replaces Terraform on IBM Cloud installations

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, the installation program uses the Cluster API instead of Terraform to provision cluster infrastructure during installations on IBM Cloud.

### Cluster API replaces Terraform on Microsoft Azure Stack Hub installations

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, the installation program uses the Cluster API instead of Terraform to provision clusters during installer-provisioned infrastructure installations on Microsoft Azure Stack Hub.

### Required administrator acknowledgment when updating from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 to 4.19

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 uses Kubernetes 1.32, which removed several deprecated APIs.

A cluster administrator must provide manual acknowledgment before the cluster can be updated from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 to 4.19. This is to help prevent issues after updating to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, where APIs that have been removed are still in use by workloads, tools, or other components running on or interacting with the cluster. Administrators must evaluate their cluster for any APIs in use that will be removed and migrate the affected components to use the appropriate new API version. After this is done, the administrator can provide the administrator acknowledgment.

All Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 clusters require this administrator acknowledgment before they can be updated to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19.

For more information, see Preparing to update to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19.

## Monitoring



## Network Observability Operator



## Networking

### Creating a route with externally managed certificate (General Availability)

With this release, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform routes can be configured with third-party certificate management solutions, utilising the .spec.tls.externalCertificate field in the route API. This allows you to reference externally managed TLS certificates through secrets, streamlining the process by eliminating manual certificate management. By using externally managed certificates, you reduce errors, ensure a smoother certificate update process, and enable the OpenShift router to promptly serve renewed certificates. For more information, see Creating a route with externally managed certificate.

### Support for using the Gateway API to configure cluster Ingress traffic

We will have details here when Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 is released.

### Support for managing the Gateway API custom resource definition (CRD) lifecycle

We will have details here when Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 is released.

### Dual-port NICs for improved redundancy in PTP ordinary clocks (Technology Preview)

With this release, you can use a dual-port network interface controller (NIC) to improve redundancy for Precision Time Protocol (PTP) ordinary clocks.
Available as a Technology Preview, in a dual-port NIC configuration for an ordinary clock, if one port fails, the standby port takes over, maintaining PTP timing synchronization.


[NOTE]
----
You can configure PTP ordinary clocks with added redundancy on x86 architecture nodes with dual-port NICs only.
----

For more information, see Using dual-port NICs to improve redundancy for PTP ordinary clocks.

### Enabling DPU device management with the DPU Operator

With this release, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform introduces the Data Processing Unit (DPU) Operator, enabling management of DPU devices. The DPU Operator manages components on compute nodes with DPUs, enabling the offloading of data workloads such as networking, storage, and security. This leads to improved cluster performance, reduced latency, and enhanced security, contributing to a more efficient infrastructure. For more information, see About DPU and the DPU Operator.

### Performance profile kernel page size configuration

With this update, you can specify larger kernel page sizes to improve performance for memory-intensive, high-performance workloads on ARM infrastructure nodes with the realtime kernel disabled. For more information, see Configuring kernel page sizes.

### Tuning hosted control planes using a performance profile

With this update, you can now tune nodes in hosted control planes for low latency by applying a performance profile. For more information, see Creating a performance profile for hosted control planes.

## Security

### Control plane now supports TLS 1.3 and the Modern TLS security profile

With this release, the control plane supports TLS 1.3. You can now use the Modern TLS security profile for the control plane.

For more information, see Configuring the TLS security profile for the control plane.

## Storage



## Web console

Starting with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, the perspectives in the web console have unified to simplify navigation, reduce context switching, streamline tasks, and provide users with a more cohesive Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform experience.

With this unified design, there is no longer a Developer perspective in the default view; however, all Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console features are discoverable to all users. If you are not the cluster owner, you might need to request permission for certain features from the cluster owner. The Developer perspective can still be manually enabled if you prefer.

The Getting Started pane in the web console provides resources such as, a tour of the console, information on setting up your cluster, a quick start for enabling the Developer perspective, and links to explore new features and capabilities.

# Notable technical changes

## Pods deploy with readOnlyRootFilesystem set to true

With this release, Cloud Credential Operator pods now deploy with the readOnlyRootFilesystem security context setting set to true. This enhances security by ensuring that the container root file system is mounted as read-only.

## Installer

* Previously, if you attempted to install an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cluster with minimum privileges and you did not specify an instance type in the install-config.yaml file, installation of the cluster failed. This issue happened because the installation program could not find supported instance types that the cluster uses in availability zones. For example, the m6i.xlarge default instance type was unavailable in ap-southeast-4 and eu-south-2 availability zones. With this release, the openshift-install program now requires the ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings AWS permission to prevent the installation of the cluster from failing in situations where m6i.xlarge or another supported instance type is unavailable in a supported availability zone.

# Known issues

* In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, clusters using IPsec for network encryption might experience intermittent loss of pod-to-pod connectivity. This prevents some pods on certain nodes from reaching services on other nodes, resulting in connection timeouts.

Internal testing could not reproduce this issue on clusters with 120 nodes or less.

There is no workaround for this issue. (OCPBUGS-55453)
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters that are installed on AWS in the Mexico Central region (mx-central-1) cannot be destroyed. (OCPBUGS-56020)
