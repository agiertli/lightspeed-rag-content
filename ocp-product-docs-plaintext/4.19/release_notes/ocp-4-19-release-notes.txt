Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform enables organizations to meet security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.

# About this release

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHSA-202X:XXXX) is now available. This release uses Kubernetes 1.32 with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 are included in this topic.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. From the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console, you can deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.8 and a later version of RHEL 8 that is released before End of Life of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 is also supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) 4.19. To understand RHEL versions used by RHCOS, see RHEL Versions Utilized by Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (Knowledgebase article).

You must use RHCOS machines for the control plane, and you can use either RHCOS or RHEL for compute machines. RHEL machines are deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 and will be removed in a future release.

Starting from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase for even-numbered releases increases the total available lifecycle to 24 months on all supported architectures, including x86_64, 64-bit ARM (aarch64), IBM Power&#174; (ppc64le), and IBM Z&#174; (s390x) architectures. Beyond this, Red&#160;Hat also offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as Additional EUS Term 2, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. For more information about support for all versions, see the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy.

Commencing with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 release, Red&#160;Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red&#160;Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see OpenShift Operator Life Cycles.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is designed for FIPS. When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see Cryptographic Module Validation Program. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see Compliance Activities and Government Standards.

## Installation and update

### Cluster API replaces Terraform on IBM Cloud installations

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, the installation program uses the Cluster API instead of Terraform to provision cluster infrastructure during installations on IBM Cloud.

### Cluster API replaces Terraform on Microsoft Azure Stack Hub installations

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, the installation program uses the Cluster API instead of Terraform to provision clusters during installer-provisioned infrastructure installations on Microsoft Azure Stack Hub.

### Outbound access for VMs in Microsoft Azure will be retired

On 30 September 2025, the default outbound access connectivity for all new virtual machines (VMs) in Microsoft Azure will be retired. To enhance security, Azure is moving towards a secure-by-default model where default outbound access to the internet will be turned off. However, configuration changes to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform are not required. By default, the installation program creates an outbound rule for the load balancer.

For more information, see Azure Updates (Microsoft documentation), Azure's outbound connectivity methods (Microsoft documentation), and Preparing to install a cluster on Azure.

### Installing a cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with a user-provisioned DNS

With this release, you can enable a user-provisioned domain name server (DNS) instead of the default cluster-provisioned DNS solution. For example, your organization&#8217;s security policies might not allow the use of public DNS services such as Google Cloud DNS. You can manage your DNS only for the IP addresses of the API and Ingress servers. If you use this feature, you must provide your own DNS solution that includes records for api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>. and *.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>..

For more information, see Enabling user-managed DNS.

### Installing a cluster on VMware vSphere with multiple disks

With this release, you can install a cluster on VMware vSphere with multiple storage disks as a Technology Preview feature. You can assign these additional disks to special functions within the cluster, such as etcd storage.

For more information, see Optional vSphere configuration parameters.

### Required administrator acknowledgment when updating from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 to 4.19

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 uses Kubernetes 1.32, which removed several deprecated APIs.

A cluster administrator must provide manual acknowledgment before the cluster can be updated from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 to 4.19. This is to help prevent issues after updating to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, where APIs that have been removed are still in use by workloads, tools, or other components running on or interacting with the cluster. Administrators must evaluate their cluster for any APIs in use that will be removed and migrate the affected components to use the appropriate new API version. After this is done, the administrator can provide the administrator acknowledgment.

All Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 clusters require this administrator acknowledgment before they can be updated to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19.

For more information, see Preparing to update to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19.

## Machine Config Operator



## Management console



## Machine management

### Custom prefixes for control plane machine names

With this release, you can customize the prefix of machine names for machines created by the control plane machine set.
This feature is enabled by modifying the spec.machineNamePrefix parameter of the ControlPlaneMachineSet custom resource.

For more information, see Adding a custom prefix to control plane machine names.

## Monitoring



## Network Observability Operator



## Networking

### Creating a route with externally managed certificate (General Availability)

With this release, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform routes can be configured with third-party certificate management solutions, utilising the .spec.tls.externalCertificate field in the route API. This allows you to reference externally managed TLS certificates through secrets, streamlining the process by eliminating manual certificate management. By using externally managed certificates, you reduce errors, ensure a smoother certificate update process, and enable the OpenShift router to promptly serve renewed certificates. For more information, see Creating a route with externally managed certificate.

### Support for using Gateway API to configure cluster ingress traffic (General Availability)

With this release, support for managing ingress cluster traffic using Gateway API resources is Generally Available. Gateway API provides a robust networking solution within the transport layer, L4, and the application layer, L7, for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters using a standardized open source ecosystem.

For more information, see Gateway API with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform networking.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Gateway API resources must conform to the supported Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API surface. This means you cannot use another vendor-specific resource, such as Istio's VirtualService, with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform's implementation of Gateway API. For more information, see Gateway API implementation for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
----

### Support for managing Gateway API custom resource definition (CRD) lifecycle

With this release, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform manages the lifecycle of Gateway API CRDs. This means that the Ingress Operator handles the required versioning and management of resources. Any Gateway API resources created in a previous Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version must be re-created and redeployed so that it conforms to the specifications required by the Ingress Operator.

For more information, see Preparing for Gateway API management succession by the Ingress Operator.

### Updates to Gateway API custom resource definitions (CRDs)

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 updates Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh to version 3.0.2, and Gateway API to version 1.2.1. See the Service Mesh 3.0.0 release notes and the Gateway API 1.2.1 changelog for more information.

### Dual-port NICs for improved redundancy in PTP ordinary clocks (Technology Preview)

With this release, you can use a dual-port network interface controller (NIC) to improve redundancy for Precision Time Protocol (PTP) ordinary clocks.
Available as a Technology Preview, in a dual-port NIC configuration for an ordinary clock, if one port fails, the standby port takes over, maintaining PTP timing synchronization.


[NOTE]
----
You can configure PTP ordinary clocks with added redundancy on x86 architecture nodes with dual-port NICs only.
----

For more information, see Using dual-port NICs to improve redundancy for PTP ordinary clocks.

### Enabling DPU device management with the DPU Operator

With this release, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform introduces the Data Processing Unit (DPU) Operator, enabling management of DPU devices. The DPU Operator manages components on compute nodes with DPUs, enabling the offloading of data workloads such as networking, storage, and security. This leads to improved cluster performance, reduced latency, and enhanced security, contributing to a more efficient infrastructure. For more information, see About DPU and the DPU Operator.

### Localnet topology for user-defined networks (Generally Available)

Administrators can now use the ClusterUserDefinedNetwork custom resource to deploy secondary networks on a Localnet topology. This feature allows pods and virtual machines connected to the localnet network to egress to the physical network. For more information, see Creating a ClusterUserDefinedNetwork CR for a Localnet topology.

### Enable port isolation for a Linux bridge NAD

You can enable port isolation for a Linux bridge network attachment definition (NAD) so that virtual machines (VMs) or pods that run on the same virtual LAN (VLAN) can operate in isolation from one another. For more information, see Enabling port isolation for a Linux bridge NAD.

### Fast IPAM configuration for the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin (Technology Preview)

To improve the performance of Whereabouts, especially if nodes in your cluster run a high amount of pods, you can now enable the Fast IP Address Management (IPAM) feature. The Fast IPAM feature uses nodeslicepools, which are managed by the Whereabouts Controller, to optimize IP address allocation for nodes. For more information, see Fast IPAM configuration for the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin.

### Unnumbered BGP peering (Technology Preview)

With this release, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform introduces unnumbered BGP peering.
Available as a Technology Preview feature, you can use the spec.interface field of the BGP peer custom resource to configure unnumbered BGP peering.

# Known issues

* In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, clusters using IPsec for network encryption might experience intermittent loss of pod-to-pod connectivity. This prevents some pods on certain nodes from reaching services on other nodes, resulting in connection timeouts.

Internal testing could not reproduce this issue on clusters with 120 nodes or less.

There is no workaround for this issue. (OCPBUGS-55453)
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters that are installed on AWS in the Mexico Central region (mx-central-1) cannot be destroyed. (OCPBUGS-56020)
* When installing a cluster on Azure, if you set compute.platform.azure.identity.type, controlplane.platform.azure.identity.type, or platform.azure.defaultMachinePlatform.identity.type to "None", your cluster is unable to pull images from the Azure Container Registry. You can avoid this issue by providing a user-assigned identity, or by leaving the identity field blank, which causes the installation program to generate a user-assigned identity. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56008)

* In the event of a crash, the mlx5_core NIC driver causes an out-of-memory issue and kdump does not save the vmcore file in /var/crash.
To save the vmcore file, use the crashkernel setting to reserve 1024 MB of memory for the kdump kernel. (OCPBUGS-54520, RHEL-90663)
* There is a known latency issue on 4th Gen Intel Xeon processors. (OCPBUGS-42495)
