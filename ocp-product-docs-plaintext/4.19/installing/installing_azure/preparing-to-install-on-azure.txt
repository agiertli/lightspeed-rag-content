# Installation methods


You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure. The default installation type uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, where the installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster. You can also install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on infrastructure that you provision. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.
See Installation process for more information about installer-provisioned and user-provisioned installation processes.

# Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on Microsoft Azure infrastructure that is provisioned by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program, by using one of the following methods:

* Installing a cluster quickly on Azure: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Azure infrastructure that is provisioned by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program. You can install a cluster quickly by using the default configuration options.
* Installing a customized cluster on Azure: You can install a customized cluster on Azure infrastructure that the installation program provisions. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available post-installation.
* Installing a cluster on Azure with network customizations: You can customize your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.
* Installing a cluster on Azure in a restricted network : You can install a cluster on Azure in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content on an existing Azure Virtual Network (VNet).
* Installing a cluster on Azure into an existing VNet: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on an existing Azure Virtual Network (VNet) on Azure. You can use this installation method if you have constraints set by the guidelines of your company, such as limits when creating new accounts or infrastructure.
* Installing a private cluster on Azure: You can install a private cluster into an existing Azure Virtual Network (VNet) on Azure. You can use this method to deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.
* Installing a cluster on Azure into a government region: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can be deployed into Microsoft Azure Government (MAG) regions that are specifically designed for US government agencies at the federal, state, and local level, as well as contractors, educational institutions, and other US customers that must run sensitive workloads on Azure.

# Installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on Azure infrastructure that you provision, by using one of the following methods:

* Installing a cluster on Azure in a restricted network with user-provisioned infrastructure: You can perform an installation on Azure that does not require an active connection to the internet to obtain software components.
* Installing a cluster on Azure using ARM templates: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Azure by using infrastructure that you provide. You can use the provided Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to assist with an installation.
