# Post-installation configuration tasks

You can perform the post-installation configuration tasks to configure your environment to meet your need.

The following lists details these configurations:

* Configure operating system features: The Machine Config Operator (MCO) manages MachineConfig objects. By using the MCO, you can configure nodes and custom resources.
* Configure cluster features. You can modify the following features of an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster:
* Image registry
* Networking configuration
* Image build behavior
* Identity provider
* The etcd configuration
* Machine set creation to handle the workloads
* Cloud provider credential management
* Configuring a private cluster: By default, the installation program provisions Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform by using a publicly accessible DNS and endpoints. To make your cluster accessible only from within an internal network, configure the following components to make them private:
* DNS
* Ingress Controller
* API server
* Perform node operations: By default, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) compute machines. You can perform the following node operations:
* Add and remove compute machines.
* Add and remove taints and tolerations.
* Configure the maximum number of pods per node.
* Enable Device Manager.
* Configure users: OAuth access tokens allow users to authenticate themselves to the API. You can configure OAuth to perform the following tasks:
* Specify an identity provider
* Use role-based access control to define and supply permissions to users
* Install an Operator from OperatorHub
* Configuring alert notifications: By default, firing alerts are displayed on the Alerting UI of the web console. You can also configure Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to send alert notifications to external systems.
