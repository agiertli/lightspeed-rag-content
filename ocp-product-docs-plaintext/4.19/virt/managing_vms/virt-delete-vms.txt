2. Click the Actions menu . beside a VM and select Delete.

Alternatively, click the VM&#8217;s name to open the VirtualMachine details page and click Actions &#8594; Delete.
3. Optional: Select With grace period or clear Delete disks.
4. Click Delete to permanently delete the VM.

# Deleting a virtual machine by using the CLI

You can delete a virtual machine (VM) by using the oc command-line interface (CLI). The oc client enables you to perform actions on multiple VMs.

* To delete the VM, you must first disable the VM's delete protection setting, if enabled.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Delete the VM by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete vm <vm_name>
```


[NOTE]
----
This command only deletes a VM in the current project. Specify the
-n <project_name> option if the VM you want to delete is in
a different project or namespace.
