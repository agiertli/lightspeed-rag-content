# About Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization

With Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, you can bring traditional virtual machines (VMs) into Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and run them alongside containers. In OpenShift Virtualization, VMs are native Kubernetes objects that you can manage by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the command line.

OpenShift Virtualization is represented by the  icon.

You can use OpenShift Virtualization the OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

# Known issues

## Monitoring

## Networking

* When you update from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 to a newer minor version, VMs that use the cnv-bridge Container Network Interface (CNI) fail to live migrate. (https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7069807)
* As a workaround, change the spec.config.type field in your NetworkAttachmentDefinition manifest from cnv-bridge to bridge before performing the update.
