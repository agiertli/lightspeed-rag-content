# About Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization

With Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, you can bring traditional virtual machines (VMs) into Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and run them alongside containers. In OpenShift Virtualization, VMs are native Kubernetes objects that you can manage by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the command line.

OpenShift Virtualization is represented by the  icon.

You can use OpenShift Virtualization the OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

## Supported cluster versions for OpenShift Virtualization

OpenShift Virtualization 4.18 is supported for use on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 clusters. To use the latest z-stream release of OpenShift Virtualization, you must first upgrade to the latest version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.


[NOTE]
----
OpenShift Virtualization is currently available on x86-64 CPUs. Arm-based nodes are not yet supported.
----

## Supported guest operating systems

To view the supported guest operating systems for OpenShift Virtualization, see Certified Guest Operating Systems in Red Hat OpenStack Platform, Red Hat Virtualization, OpenShift Virtualization and Red Hat Enterprise Linux with KVM.

## Microsoft Windows SVVP certification

OpenShift Virtualization is certified in Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Server Virtualization Validation Program (SVVP) to run Windows Server workloads.

The SVVP certification applies to:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS workers. In the Microsoft SVVP Catalog, they are named Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 on RHEL CoreOS 9.
* Intel and AMD CPUs.

# Quick starts

Quick start tours are available for several OpenShift Virtualization features. To view the tours, click the Help icon ? in the menu bar on the header of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console and then select Quick Starts. You can filter the available tours by entering the keyword virtualization in the Filter field.

# New and changed features

This release adds new features and enhancements related to the following components and concepts:

## Installation and update



## Infrastructure

* You can now prevent the inadvertent deletion of a virtual machine (VM) by enabling delete protection for the VM. You can also disable delete protection that has been set for a VM.

As a cluster administrator, you can prevent users from enabling VM delete protection by removing the option at the cluster level.

## Virtualization

* You can now choose to expand virtual machines (VMs) using instance types and preferences. For more information, see Using InstancetypeReferencePolicy to expand VirtualMachines in the Red Hat Customer Portal.

## Networking

* You can now configure a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest to enable the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) listener for all ethernet ports in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

## Storage

* You can now use a PVC as the source of a custom DataImportCron in the dataImportCronTemplates section of the HyperConverged custom resource (CR). See Managing automatic boot source updates for more information.

## Web console

* You can now configure multiple IOThreads for virtual machines that use fast storage, such as SSD (solid-state drive) or NVMe (non-volatile memory express). This improves I/O performance by enabling multiple threads for disk access.

## Monitoring

* The following alerts for the OpenShift Virtualization Operator are now included in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform runbooks:
* HAControlPlaneDown
* HighCPUWorkload
* NodeNetworkInterfaceDown

## Documentation improvements



## Notable technical changes



# Deprecated and removed features

## Deprecated features

Deprecated features are included in the current release and supported. However, they will be removed in a future release and are not recommended for new deployments.

* The OperatorConditionsUnhealthy alert is deprecated. You can safely silence it.

## Removed features

Removed features are no longer supported in OpenShift Virtualization.

# Technology Preview features

Some features in this release are currently in Technology Preview. These experimental features are not intended for production use. Note the following scope of support on the Red Hat Customer Portal for these features:

Technology Preview Features Support Scope

* You can now manage the link state of a primary or secondary virtual machine (VM) interface by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the CLI.

* OpenShift Virtualization is now supported on Azure Boost.

* The DevKubeVirtRelieveAndMigrate descheduler profile is now available. This profile enhances the LongLifecycle profile by supporting load-aware descheduling, dynamic soft taints, and improved workload rebalancing.

* You can now deploy OpenShift Virtualization on IPv6 single-stack clusters. Support for IPv6 single-stack is limited to the OVN-Kubernetes localnet and Linux bridge Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins.

# Bug fixes



# Known issues

## Monitoring

## Networking

* When you update from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 to a newer minor version, VMs that use the cnv-bridge Container Network Interface (CNI) fail to live migrate. (https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7069807)
* As a workaround, change the spec.config.type field in your NetworkAttachmentDefinition manifest from cnv-bridge to bridge before performing the update.

## Nodes

* Uninstalling OpenShift Virtualization does not remove the feature.node.kubevirt.io node labels created by OpenShift Virtualization. You must remove the labels manually. (CNV-38543)

## Storage

* If you clone more than 100 VMs using the csi-clone cloning strategy, the Ceph CSI might not purge the clones. Manually deleting the clones might also fail. (CNV-23501)
* As a workaround, you can restart the ceph-mgr daemon to purge the VM clones.

* If you perform storage class migration for a stopped VM, the VM might not be able to start because of a missing bootable device. To prevent this, do not attempt storage class migration if the VM is not running. (CNV-55104)

[IMPORTANT]
----
Storage class migration is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

## Virtualization

* When the mode of live migration is PostCopy, hot-plugging CPU or memory resource fails. (CNV-48348)

* OpenShift Virtualization links a service account token in use by a pod to that specific pod. OpenShift Virtualization implements a service account volume by creating a disk image that contains a token. If you migrate a VM, then the service account volume becomes invalid. (CNV-33835)
* As a workaround, use user accounts rather than service accounts because user account tokens are not bound to a specific pod.

## Web console

## IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE


[IMPORTANT]
----
Using OpenShift Virtualization with s390x architecture is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

* When you create a VM by using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) container disk images for s390x architecture, call traces referencing virtio_balloon print to the VM console. (OCPBUGS-51113)
* As a workaround, add the following parameter to the VM YAML configuration: spec.autoattachMemBalloon: false.

* VMs based on s390x architecture can only use the IPL boot mode. However, in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, the Boot mode list for s390x VMs incorrectly includes BIOS, UEFI, and UEFI (secure) boot modes. If you select one of these modes for an s390x-based VM, the operation fails. (CNV-56889)

* In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, it is erroneously possible to define multiple CPU threads for a VM based on s390x architecture. If you define multiple CPU threads, the VM enters a CrashLoopBackOff state with the qemu-kvm: S390 does not support more than 1 threads error. (CNV-56890)
