# Configuring hybrid networking


As a cluster administrator, you can configure the Red Hat OpenShift Networking OVN-Kubernetes network plugin to allow Linux and Windows nodes to host Linux and Windows workloads, respectively.

# Configuring hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes

You can configure your cluster to use hybrid networking with the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin. This allows a hybrid cluster that supports different node networking configurations.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in to the cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* Ensure that the cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.

1. To configure the OVN-Kubernetes hybrid network overlay, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch networks.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge \
  -p '{
    "spec":{
      "defaultNetwork":{
        "ovnKubernetesConfig":{
          "hybridOverlayConfig":{
            "hybridClusterNetwork":[
              {
                "cidr": "<cidr>",
                "hostPrefix": <prefix>
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

where:
cidr:: Specify the CIDR configuration used for nodes on the additional overlay network. This CIDR must not overlap with the cluster network CIDR.
hostPrefix:: Specifies the subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if hostPrefix is set to 23, then each node is assigned a /23 subnet out of the given cidr, which allows for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IP addresses. If you are required to provide access to nodes from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.
Example output

```text
network.operator.openshift.io/cluster patched
```

2. To confirm that the configuration is active, enter the following command. It can take several minutes for the update to apply.

```terminal
$ oc get network.operator.openshift.io -o jsonpath="{.items[0].spec.defaultNetwork.ovnKubernetesConfig}"
```
