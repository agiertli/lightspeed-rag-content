# About image-based installation for single-node OpenShift


Use the openshift-install program to create a live installation ISO for preinstalling single-node OpenShift on bare-metal hosts. For more information about downloading the installation program, see "Installation process" in the "Additional resources" section.
The installation program takes a seed image URL and other inputs, such as the release version of the seed image and the disk to use for the installation process, and creates a live installation ISO. You can then start the host using the live installation ISO to begin preinstallation. When preinstallation is complete, the host is ready to ship to a remote site for the final site-specific configuration and deployment.
The following are the high-level steps to preinstall a single-node OpenShift cluster using an image-based installation:
* Generate a seed image.
* Create a live installation ISO using the openshift-install installation program.
* Boot the host using the live installation ISO to preinstall the host.
* Installation process

# Creating a live installation ISO for a single-node OpenShift image-based installation

You can embed your single-node OpenShift seed image URL, and other installation artifacts, in a live installation ISO by using the openshift-install program.


[NOTE]
----
For more information about the specification for the image-based-installation-config.yaml manifest, see the section "Reference specifications for the image-based-installation-config.yaml manifest".
----

* You generated a seed image from a single-node OpenShift seed cluster.
* You downloaded the latest version of the openshift-install program.
* The target host has network access to the seed image URL and all other installation artifacts.
* If you require static networking, you must install the nmstatectl library on the host that creates the live installation ISO.

1. Create a live installation ISO and embed your single-node OpenShift seed image URL and other installation artifacts:
1. Create a working directory by running the following:

```terminal
$ mkdir ibi-iso-workdir 1
```

Replace ibi-iso-workdir with the name of your working directory.
2. Optional. Create an installation configuration template to use as a reference when configuring the ImageBasedInstallationConfig resource:

```terminal
$ openshift-install image-based create image-config-template --dir ibi-iso-workdir 1
```

If you do not specify a working directory, the command uses the current directory.
Example output

```terminal
INFO Image-Config-Template created in: ibi-iso-workdir
```


The command creates the image-based-installation-config.yaml installation configuration template in your target directory:

```yaml
#
# Note: This is a sample ImageBasedInstallationConfig file showing
# which fields are available to aid you in creating your
# own image-based-installation-config.yaml file.
#
apiVersion: v1beta1
kind: ImageBasedInstallationConfig
metadata:
  name: example-image-based-installation-config
# The following fields are required
seedImage: quay.io/openshift-kni/seed-image:4.17.0
seedVersion: 4.17.0
installationDisk: /dev/vda
pullSecret: '<your_pull_secret>'
# networkConfig is optional and contains the network configuration for the host in NMState format.
# See https://nmstate.io/examples.html for examples.
# networkConfig:
#   interfaces:
#     - name: eth0
#       type: ethernet
#       state: up
#       mac-address: 00:00:00:00:00:00
#       ipv4:
#         enabled: true
#         address:
#           - ip: 192.168.122.2
#             prefix-length: 23
#         dhcp: false
```

3. Edit your installation configuration file:
Example image-based-installation-config.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1beta1
kind: ImageBasedInstallationConfig
metadata:
  name: example-image-based-installation-config
seedImage: quay.io/repo-id/seed:latest
seedVersion: "4.17.0"
extraPartitionStart: "-240G"
installationDisk: /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x62c...
sshKey: 'ssh-ed25519 AAAA...'
pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}'
networkConfig:
    interfaces:
      - name: ens1f0
        type: ethernet
        state: up
        ipv4:
          enabled: true
          dhcp: false
          auto-dns: false
          address:
            - ip: 10.6.85.8
              prefix-length: 24
        ipv6:
          enabled: false
    dns-resolver:
      config:
        server:
          - 10.6.73.2
          - 10.6.73.4
    routes:
      config:
      - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
        metric: 150
        next-hop-address: 10.6.85.254
        next-hop-interface: ens1f0
```

4. Create the live installation ISO by running the following command:

```terminal
$ openshift-install image-based create image --dir ibi-iso-workdir
```

Example output

```terminal
INFO Consuming Image-based Installation ISO Config from target directory
INFO Creating Image-based Installation ISO with embedded ignition
```


* View the output in the working directory:

```text
ibi-iso-workdir/
  └── rhcos-ibi.iso
```


* Reference specifications for the image-based-installation-config.yaml manifest

# Provisioning the live installation ISO to a host

Using your preferred method, boot the target bare-metal host from the rhcos-ibi.iso live installation ISO to preinstall single-node OpenShift.

1. Login to the target host.
2. View the system logs by running the following command:

```terminal
$ journalctl -b
```

Example output

```terminal
