# Logging UI plugin


The logging UI plugin surfaces logging data in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console on the Observe -> Logs page.
You can specify filters, queries, time ranges and refresh rates, with the results displayed as a list of collapsed logs, which can then be expanded to show more detailed information for each log.
When you have also deployed the Troubleshooting UI plugin on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.16+, it connects to the Korrel8r service and adds direct links from the Administration perspective, from the Observe -> Logs page, to the Observe -> Metrics page with a correlated PromQL query. It also adds a See Related Logs link from the Administration perspective alerting detail page, at Observe -> Alerting,  to the Observe -> Logs page with a correlated filter set selected.
The features of the plugin are categorized as:
dev-console:: Adds the logging view to the Developer perspective.
alerts:: Merges the web console alerts with log-based alerts defined in the Loki ruler. Adds a log-based metrics chart in the alert detail view.
dev-alerts:: Merges the web console alerts with log-based alerts defined in the Loki ruler. Adds a log-based metrics chart in the alert detail view for the Developer perspective.
